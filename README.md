This piece of code is designed to read in a matrix from a text file generated by a separate program with the format:
# ./mat_gen --rows 3 --cols 4 --max 10.0 --min 0.0
# Version = 1.0.2, Revision date = 15-Oct-2019
matrix 3 4
<DATA>
end
where the first two lines describe information about the generated matrix, followed by a definition of the matrix size, then
the data, which is three lines of four tab-separated random values in the interval [0,10] in this example, and finally an end 
statement. Matrices of this format are produced from code written by Dr C.D.H Williams named "mat_gen.c". This text file is 
read in and stored by the program as a 1-D array, and one of six operation can be called by the user to be applied to the 
matrix. These are called as follows: 
-f matrix_1.txt 					Frobenius norm of matrix_1
-t matrix_1.txt 					Transpose of matrix_1
-m matrix_1.txt	matrix_2.txt 		Matrix product matrix_1.matrix_2
-d matrix_1.txt 					Determinant of matrix_1 (square)
-a matrix_1.txt 					Adjoint of matrix_1 (square)
-i matrix_1.txt 					Inverse of matrix_1 (square)
A final command can be used to provide a filename for the output matrix to be written in to, which can then be used as input
for the code again. Calling from the command line is as follows:
-o output.txt						Stores the output matrix in a file output.txt
The operations in this code are called using a getoptlong() function in the main, adapted from Dr C.D.H Williams' matrix 
generating code, before calling the required functions as specified.
For functions which output a single value, such as the Frobenius norm or the determinant, the output will be a 1x1 matrix
with the value beneath. Checks are performed on the request of -d,-a,-i to make sure that the input matrix is square, as 
these functions do not work with non-square matrices.
The code works well for all matrices up to 11x11, after which the run time becomes a significant factor, so it is recommended
to only use these for matrices of 11x11 or smaller. A 12x12 matrix takes up to 6 minutes to run and a 13x13 is estimated to 
be around an hour.
An example of an input and output is shown below for a 5x5 matrix, showing all functions, with the product being the 
multiplication of the matrix with itself.
